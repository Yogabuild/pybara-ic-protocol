# Pybara SDK v1.4.0 - Explicit Naming & Logging

**Release Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Version:** 1.4.0  
**Type:** Major improvement - Better developer experience

---

## 🎯 **What Changed**

We renamed all functions and improved logging to be **crystal clear** about what's happening at each step of the payment flow.

---

## 📝 **Function Name Changes**

### Before (Confusing):
```javascript
executePayment()    // Execute WHAT payment? To WHO?
initPayment()       // Initialize WHAT?
recordPayment()     // Record WHAT?
confirmPayment()    // Confirm WHAT?
```

### After (Explicit):
```javascript
sendCustomerPaymentToCanister()     // Customer → Canister
createPaymentRecord()               // Database entry
verifyAndRecordCustomerPayment()    // Check tokens arrived
executePayoutToMerchant()          // Canister → Merchant + Platform
```

## 🔄 **Payment Flow (Now Crystal Clear)**

```
STEP 1: Calculate Amount
   → Backend: calculate_payment_amount($8.14, ckBTC)
   → Returns: 7347 satoshis
   
STEP 2: Customer Payment to Canister
   → sendCustomerPaymentToCanister(7347, canister, ckBTC)
   → "💳 Customer paying: 0.00007347 ckBTC to canister..."
   → "✅ Customer payment sent (Block: 3210555)"
   
STEP 3: Create Payment Record
   → createPaymentRecord({orderId, merchant, usdAmount...})
   → "✅ Payment record created in database"
   → Status: "pending"
   
STEP 4: Verify Customer Payment
   → verifyAndRecordCustomerPayment(paymentId, txId, amount)
   → "🔍 Verifying customer payment on-chain..."
   → Checks block 3210555 exists
   → Confirms tokens in canister
   → "✅ Customer payment verified"
   → Status: "recorded"
   
STEP 5: Execute Payout
   → executePayoutToMerchant(paymentId, merchant)
   → "💸 Executing payout to merchant (99%) and platform (1%)..."
   → Transfers to merchant: Block 3210556
   → Transfers to platform: Block 3210557
   → "✅ Merchant payout complete"
   → "✅ Platform fee complete"
   → "✅ Payment flow complete"
   → Status: "confirmed"
```

## 🔧 **API Changes (Backwards Compatible)**

### Old Function Names Still Work
All old function names are kept as **@deprecated** aliases:

```javascript
// Old way (still works):
await gateway.executePayment(amount, recipient, token);
await gateway.initPayment(params);
await gateway.recordPayment(paymentId, orderId, ...);
await gateway.confirmPayment(paymentId, orderId, ...);

// New way (explicit):
await gateway.sendCustomerPaymentToCanister(amount, canister, token);
await gateway.createPaymentRecord(params);
await gateway.verifyAndRecordCustomerPayment(paymentId, txId, ...);
await gateway.executePayoutToMerchant(paymentId, merchant);
```

**Migration:** No breaking changes! Update at your own pace.

---

## 💡 **Why This Matters**

### Before:
```
❌ "Payment initialized" - What does this mean?
❌ "Transfer complete" - To who? From who?
❌ "Confirming payment" - Which payment? What's being confirmed?
```

### After:
```
✅ "Customer payment sent" - Clear: Customer → Canister
✅ "Payment record created" - Clear: Database entry
✅ "Customer payment verified" - Clear: Checking on-chain
✅ "Merchant payout complete" - Clear: Canister → Merchant
```

---

## 🐛 **Debugging Benefits**

When something goes wrong, logs now tell you **exactly** where:

```
✅ Customer payment sent (Block: 3210555)
✅ Payment record created in database (ID: 79, Status: pending)
🔍 Verifying customer payment on-chain...
❌ Customer payment verification failed: Block not found

→ Problem: Block 3210555 doesn't exist or wallet lied
→ Solution: Check wallet integration (Plug bug!)
```

vs old way:
```
✅ Transfer complete (Block: 3210555)
✅ Payment initialized
❌ Failed to record payment

→ Problem: ???
→ Solution: ???
```

---

## 📦 **What's Included**

- ✅ 4 renamed functions (with backwards compat)
- ✅ Explicit logging at every step
- ✅ Clear error messages
- ✅ Debug mode shows all details
- ✅ No breaking changes

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### Enable Debug Mode
Add to `wp-config.php`:
```php
define('WP_DEBUG', true);
```

### See Beautiful Logs
```javascript
const gateway = new PybaraAgent({
    canisterId: 'zvgwv-zyaaa-aaaac-qchaq-cai',
    debug: true  // Enable detailed logging
});
```

## 📝 **Migration Guide**

### Option 1: Do Nothing
Old function names still work. No action needed.

### Option 2: Update to New Names (Recommended)
```javascript
// Find & Replace:
executePayment           → sendCustomerPaymentToCanister
initPayment             → createPaymentRecord
recordPayment           → verifyAndRecordCustomerPayment
confirmPayment          → executePayoutToMerchant
```

---

## 🎓 **Learning the Flow**

With explicit names, new developers can understand the flow instantly:

1. **Send**CustomerPaymentToCanister
2. **Create**PaymentRecord
3. **VerifyAndRecord**CustomerPayment
4. **ExecutePayout**ToMerchant

No guessing. No confusion. Crystal clear! ✨
